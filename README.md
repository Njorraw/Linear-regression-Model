Linear Regression Model 📈

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the implementation of Linear Regression using Python and Scikit-learn. The project analyzes real-world data to predict outcomes, such as admission chances, based on input variables.

🧠 Key Notebooks
- `Admission_analysis.ipynb`: Linear regression on university admissions data
- `Copy_of_Untitled6.ipynb`: Exploratory model tests and feature experimentation
- `Untitled3.ipynb`: Basic regression setup using Colab

🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (via Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

🏁 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` files in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells to see the model in action
